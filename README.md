# I2C/IIC/I²C-VHDL-Model
This is my Final year project, it consists on developping a VHDL Model of the I2C Bus.
We are going to start this project with defining the different components, functionalities, specificities and drivers that need to be considered while creating the models.
## I2C-Bus: What’s that?
The I2C bus was designed to allow easy communication between components (low-speed devices like microcontrollers, EEPROMs, A/D and D/A converters, I/O interfaces and other similar peripherals in embedded systems) which reside on the same circuit board.

I2C Bus is easy to use, most significant features are:  
 * Only 2 wires with pull-up resistors are needed to connect unlimited number of I2C devices:  
      1.SDA: Serial Data line controlled by Master and Slave  
      2.SCL: Serial Clock generated by Master.  
      Both SDA and SCL are open drained (made of a transistor with no connection on top. Without external circuitry they can't really be         used).
      SDA must be pulled up to VCC with a 5.6-kilo-ohm resistor and SCL also needs to be pulled up with the same resistor only if there         are multiple masters in the system or when the slave want to synchronise with the master.
 * Synchronous , bidirectional and Half duplex.
 * A true multi-master and multi-slave bus.  
 * Each device connected to the bus is software-addressable by a unique address.    
 ## Communication Mode ( Baude Rate)  
  * Slow Mode: 100Kb/sec  
  * Fast Mode: 400Kb/sec  
  * High Speed Mode: 3.4Mbit/sec  
  * Fast Mode Plus 1Mhz  
  * Ultra Fast Mode 5Mhz ( is no real I2C).  
 ## Establishing Connection
 The I²C protocol comprises a set of conditions to establish communication between the devices. These include:
 1. Start condition
 2. Sending of the slave address along with read/write information by the master
 3. Acknowledgement by the slave device
 4. Data transmission between the master and the slave device
 5. Stop condition
