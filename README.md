# I2C-VHDL-Model
This is my Final year project, it consists on developping a VHDL Model of the I2C Bus.
We are going to start this project with defining the different components, functionalities, specificities and drivers that need to be considered while creating the models.
## I2C-Bus: Whatâ€™s that?
The I2C bus was designed to allow easy communication between components (low-speed devices like microcontrollers, EEPROMs, A/D and D/A converters, I/O interfaces and other similar peripherals in embedded systems) which reside on the same circuit board.
